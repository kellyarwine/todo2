# Todo2

A simple todo application with advanced mention and thread functionality.

## Overview

Todo2 is a task management application that supports collaborative features through mentions and threaded discussions. This repository contains the core functionality for managing todos with social interaction capabilities.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- Create, edit, and delete todo items
- Mark todos as complete/incomplete
- Organize todos with priorities and categories

### Mention System
The application supports a robust mention system that allows users to:
- **@mention** other users in todo comments and descriptions
- Receive notifications when mentioned in todos or comments
- Handle multiple mentions within a single thread efficiently
- Track mention history and engagement

### Thread Support
- Create discussion threads on any todo item
- Reply to comments within threads
- Maintain conversation context and history
- Support for nested conversations and replies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the necessary runtime environment set up
- Check the `test` file for basic functionality verification

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kellyarwine/todo2.git
   cd todo2
   ```

2. Run the test to verify basic functionality:
   ```bash
   cat test
   ```

### Usage

#### Basic Todo Operations
- Create new todos with descriptions and priorities
- Update todo status and details
- Delete completed or unnecessary todos

#### Using Mentions
When creating or commenting on todos, you can mention other users:
```
@username Please review this todo item
```

**What happens with many mentions in a thread?**
The system is designed to handle threads with multiple mentions efficiently:
- Each mentioned user receives appropriate notifications
- Mention tracking prevents spam and duplicate notifications
- Thread context is preserved across all mentions
- Performance remains optimal even with high mention volume

#### Working with Threads
- Click on any todo to start a discussion thread
- Reply to existing comments to maintain conversation flow
- Use mentions within threads to involve specific team members
- Track thread activity and engagement metrics
