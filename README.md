# Todo2

A simple and efficient todo list application designed for managing tasks and threaded discussions.

## Overview

Todo2 is a lightweight todo list application that supports both individual task management and threaded conversations. This project aims to provide a clean interface for organizing tasks while enabling collaborative discussions through mentions and threading features.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, update, and organize your todos
- **Threading Support**: Engage in threaded discussions on tasks
- **Mentions System**: Tag and notify team members using @mentions
- **Scalable Architecture**: Optimized to handle threads with many mentions efficiently

## Threading and Mentions

### Handling Threads with Many Mentions

One of the key design considerations for Todo2 is efficiently managing threads that contain numerous mentions. Here's what happens when a thread accumulates many mentions:

1. **Performance Optimization**: The system uses pagination and lazy loading to ensure threads remain responsive even with hundreds of mentions
2. **Notification Management**: Users receive consolidated notifications to avoid spam when multiple mentions occur in rapid succession
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Only visible mentions are loaded into memory, with background loading for additional content
4. **Search and Filter**: Advanced filtering options help users navigate through large mention volumes quickly

### Best Practices for Mentions

- Use specific @mentions to target relevant team members
- Consider using @channel or @here sparingly in busy threads
- Utilize threaded replies to keep discussions organized
- Archive or close threads when discussions are complete
